# Factory Island

Start from nothing but dirt and a tree and eventually lead your way to beating the game with create machines to automate your way to the end!

Progression is simple! Start with only rough machines and materials, learn how to extract iron from the ground then use the iron to slowly automate more in the desolate void

This modpack is foucused around create with augements to create and vanilla progression to make it work in the sky
